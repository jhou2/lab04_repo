    <h1>Problems of electronic waste</h1>
    <ol>
    	<li>People are switching electronic devices much more frequently compared to the past due to the
				variety of new products released every year to lure people into buying new devices. </li>
			<li>Manufacturing companies make products with high fragility, which prompts customers to purchase
				warranties or to desire new products altogether.</li>
			<li>Old electronic devices are often left at home, and people usually forget about it.
				Very few electronic devices are properly recycled.</li>
			<li>The lack of awareness of E-waste recycling is alarming.</li>
</ol>

	<h1>Definition of E-waste</h1>

	<p>Electronic landfill, coined “e-waste”, is a growing global issue that affects environment worldwide.
		E-waste is the collection of unwanted or “out-of-date” products that are replaced by newer or better
		models in technological advancements (i.e. changing iPhone 5 → iPhone 6 → iPhone X).  Most of these
		products have an expected life expectancy from purchase date to the release of a better version of the same product.

	<h1>Name: Anthony Verklushberg<br/>Job: Electronic Technician
</h1>
	<p>Anthony is a senior electronic technician at I-Buy-Mobi (IBM) of over 5 years.
		IBM’s offers a main service of refurbishing and recycling old phones and electronic devices.
		Anthony's main duty in the company is to investigate claims of shoddy performance of electronic
		devices after a certain amount of time after purchasing the device. From collected data, almost
		50% of the electronics deposited at IBM are in perfect condition, with the only complaint that
		they are “out of date” and are slower than more recent designs. Anthony believes that these
		old devices can be refurbished and reused in different environments, but the CEO believes that
		they should all be sent to landfill. Anthony wishes to find an alternative.
		<p>This was our third persona</p>
		<p>What now? Another conflict.</p>

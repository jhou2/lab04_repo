	<br/><h3>Name: Anthony Verklushberg<br/>Job: Electronic Technicin</h3>
	<p id = "description">Anthony is a senior electronic technician at I-Buy-Mobi (IBM) of over 5 years.
		IBM’s offers a main service of refurbishing and recycling old phones and electronic devices.
		Anthony's main duty in the company is to investigate claims of shoddy performance of electronic
		devices after a certain amount of time after purchasing the device. From collected data, almost
		50% of the electronics deposited at IBM are in perfect condition, with the only complaint that
		they are “out of date” and are slower than more recent designs. Anthony believes that these
		old devices can be refurbished and reused in different environments, but the CEO believes that
		they should all be sent to landfill. Anthony wishes to find an alternative.
</p>
<h3>Goals:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>To recycle e-waste in a way that is lucrative and environmentally sustainable.</li>
	<li>To discover new environments in which old devices can fit into (part recycling,
		extra monitor screen, or cheaper, slower computers for those who cannot afford the newer models).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Frustrations:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The industry is difficult to keep up with due to the consistent upgrades. </li>
	<li>Industry focuses on current models rather than newer ones. </li>
	<li>The industry creates too much e-waste in domestic households.</li>
</ul>

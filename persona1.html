	<h1>Name: Mohammed Hindash<br>Job: Makeup Artist
</h1>
	<p>Mohammed works at Channel as a makeup artist. He meets various people on daily basis like  model and artists who are very trendy and fashionable. He saw that most of people who are working in the fashion industry change their gadgets and smartphones way too often then necessary. 
He thinks that buying new gadgets whenever new products come out pollutes the environment seriously. There are some companies that refurbish or buy used electronic devices, but  he  thinks people are not aware of them well. <br>
He believes  there should be a better way to promote recycling electronic devices.
</p>
<ul><h3>His goal</h3>

<li>To see people use their electronic devices longer</li> 
<li>Introduce people a new innovative website or app that helps reduce E waste.</li>
<li>Settle an environment-friendly atmosphere at his workplace. He’s already well-known as an environment proactivist at work because he only uses products that’s biodegradable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Experiences</h3> 
<p>He thinks he can promote the E devices recycling website better than anyone since he  knows a lot of people who have huge influence on society like celebrities and famous people. </p>
<h3>Frustrations</h3> 
<p>He thinks manufacturers of cell phone (Apple, Samsung) make their product too fragile so the people change their cell phone often.<p>

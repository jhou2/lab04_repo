	<h1>Name: Mohammed Hindash<br>Job: Makeup Artist
</h1>
	<p>Mohammed works at Channel as a makeup artist. He meets various people on daily basis like  model and artists who are very trendy and fashionable. He saw that most of people who are working in the fashion industry change their gadgets and smartphones way too often then necessary. 
He thinks that buying new gadgets whenever new products come out pollutes the environment seriously. There are some companies that refurbish or buy used electronic devices, but  he  thinks people are not aware of them well. <br>
He believes  there should be a better way to promote recycling electronic devices.
